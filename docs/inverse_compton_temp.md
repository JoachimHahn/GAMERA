Inverse Compton Tutorial
========================

In this tutorial we will see in some more detail how to set up the radiation fields for the Inverse Compton scattering
for both isotropic and anisotropic case. In the following we assume that `fr` is an instance of the class `Radiation`.

GAMERA allows the user to add directly a thermal photon field knowing the temperature and the energy density through the
function:
```python
fr.AddThermalTargetPhotons(temperature,energy_density)
```
The units to be used are Kelvin degrees for the temperature and erg/cm<sup>3</sup> for the energy density.

For a more particular usage, it is also possible to add arbitrary photon fields via
```python
fr.AddArbitraryTargetPhotons(photon_array)
```
where `photon_array` is an array of tuples \(E,photon_density\) in units of `erg` vs `erg^-1 cm^-3`.

A further possibility is to import a photon field from file with:
```python
fr.ImportTargetPhotonsFromFile(filename)
```
where the structure of the file must be `energy [eV]` vs `number density [cm^-3]`.


Case 1: Isotropic photon fields
-------------------------------

Let's start with the simple case of a thermal photon field. In principle we can add multiple photon fields. In the default
case, when asking for the Inverse Compton component of the gamma ray sectrum, it will be computed on the sum of the
photon fields. If we explicitily want the component associated to the i-th field, the code will recompute the component
associated only to that field:
```python
fr.GetICSpectrum()  # IC spectrum for the sum of all the target photon fields.
fr.GetICSED()       # IC SED for the sum of all the target photon fields.
```
or
```python
fr.GetICSpectrum(0)  # IC spectrum for the target photon field 0
fr.GetICSED(0)       # IC SED for the target photon field 0
```
Case 2: Anisotropic photon fields
---------------------------------

In this section we will go through the steps to consider anisotropic fields.
The first step is to give give an angular dependency to the target photon field. There are here 2 possibilities:
 1. anisotropic beam of electrons
 2. isotropic distribution of electrons

Before going into the details of the 2 cases, here is the geometry used in GAMERA

In the following figure it is illustrated how the angles are defined together with the direction of the electrons \(in case 1.\)
and the direction of the line of sight \(always along the x-axis\)

![geometry](anisotropy_geometry_v3.png) 

so the phi angle goes from 0 to 2\*pi and the theta angle from 0 to pi.

If you work in python, the angular dependency can be implemented by filling a `numpy.meshgrid`:
```python
phi = np.linspace(1.,1.5,20)          # angles from 1 to 1.5 radiants divided in 20 bins
theta = np.linspace(0.5,1.,20)        # angles from 0.5 to 1 radiant divided in 20 bins
ph_m, th_m = np.meshgrid(phi, theta)  # defining the meshgrid
distr = fill_grid(ph_m,th_m)          # fill the meshgrid with a user defined function
```
The filled grid `distr` needs to be normalized over solid angle by the user \(see the example scripts\).
Once we have the angular distribution of the photon field, we can complete the geometry of the system.

### Anisotropic distribution of electrons

At the moment, this is the default case implemented in GAMERA. The full geometry of the IC scattering in this case is done
with the following function:
```python
fr.SetTargetPhotonAnisotropy(target, angles_e, phi, theta, distr)
```
where `target` is the index of the target field we want to make anisotropic, `angles_e` is an array `[phi,theta]` for
the direction of the electron beam and the other variables are the same as above.

At this point GAMERA will use the angular dependent cross section to compute the IC scattering and the results can
be explored with the previous methods.

### Isotropic distribution of electrons

This is a rather recent addition to the code. In case we have a isotropic distribution of electrons, we can follow the same steps as before additionally stating that our electrons are isotropically distributed:
```python
fr.SetElectronsIsotropic()
fr.SetTargetPhotonAnisotropy(target, angles_e, phi, theta, distr)
```
the first function will set an inner GAMERA variable so that the code will use an isotropic distribution of electrons. The second function is exactly the same as before, but the variable `angles_e` will not actually be used in the calculations.

At the moment the code does not allow to switch back from an isotropic distribution of electrons to an anisotropic one. We would recommend not to mix the two options and use only one of the possibilities at a time.
